        <h4>YOGA</h4>
        <p>One of my favorite ways to release stress and recenter my mind. The balance of the breath and the focus on my muscles gives me a much needed reset from the city. Another short sentence goes here.</p>

        <h4>SCIENCE</h4>
        <p>I have always been facinated by science and how things work. As a kid, I would often times convince my friends to do experiments with me. I still practice many experiments when I want to know what will happen.</p>

        <h4>HIKING</h4>
        <p>Since I was a child, I have been hiking with my family. We have hiked from our backyard in the Redwood Forest in California to the side of a glacier in Alaska. No matter how old I get, I enjoy the outdoors and peacefulness of hiking.</p>

        <h4>WINE</h4>
        <p>During my time in northern California, I had the wonderful experience working at a vinyard and winery. I learned as much as I could about wine while I was there, from what a brix is to how different oak can change the wine.</p>
