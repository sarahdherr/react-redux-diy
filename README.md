# React-redux library DIY

I made this library to illustrate what react-redux is doing under the hood. It should be noted that this is not exactly how the react-redux library is made, but follows a similar set-up.

## Test out the library:

1. Clone this repo onto your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/sarahdherr/react-redux-diy.git
cd react-redux-diy
```
2. Download needed dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Start the program
```
npm start
```
4. Go to the browser (localhost:3000)
